### 1. About the Club

Board Members:

**Kyle Duffy - Chairperson**    

Senior, Mathematics and Computer Science    

Working at Belvedere Trading

kduffy5@nd.edu

I started my career in trading when I read *The Intelligent Investor* by Benjamin Graham. Now I primarily focus on merging statistics and computing to create systematic options trading strategies. I love what I do and always like to learn more about math and computing!

**Sam Gruenler - Managing Director**

Junior, Economics and ACMS

Working at Group One Trading

sgruenle@nd.edu

I’ve been interested in problems involving math and markets since high school, and when I discovered the quant trading field, it seemed like a great combination of these interests. Since then, I’ve focused particularly on applying statistics to commodity derivatives, and I’ll be working at Group One Trading next summer.

**Matteo Cosentino**

Junior, Physics and Economics

Working at Bank of America

mcosenti@nd.edu

I began investing many years before college, but once I discovered the power of computational physics, I saw the opportunity to apply this to my investing strategies. Since then I have worked at Wolfe Research, a quantitative research firm, and will be working for Bank of America’s quant group next summer.

**Ben Gluckow**

Junior, ACMS and Economics

Working at SIG

bgluckow@nd.edu

I came into Notre Dame thinking that I would be more interested in working in data science or technology. I stumbled across quant trading in my career search, and it seemed like a great fit for applying technical skills to interesting financial problems. I have worked at Analysis Group, an economic consulting firm, and will be with SIG’s ETF desk next summer. 

**Luke Distefano**

Junior, Economics and ACMS

ldistefa@nd.edu

Coming to Notre Dame, I was drawn to the application of mathematical methods to learn more about the economy. Previously, I worked in the Offices of Sustainability and Business Systems in South Dining Hall in order to find more efficient and sustainable initiatives for on-campus dining locations. Once I heard about the application of statistical analysis to investment strategies, I have been deeply engaged in becoming an expert as well as professional in the field.

**Peter Christie**

Sophomore, Business Analytics and ACMS

pchrist1@nd.edu

I have always been interested in the intersection math and statistics have with economics and markets, particularly as it has to do with data science. I hope to combine these passions into a career which allows for the opportunity to use data to drive performance.

**Hanna Ferdynus**
 
Sophomore, Finance and ACMS

hferdynu@nd.edu

I have always liked math and I would like to use it in my professional career. I'm hoping to connect my future with financial services and quantitative finance is one of the fields I find particularly attractive.

### 3. GitHub and Git

What is GitHub?

* GitHub is a web server meant for managing *git clients*
* The *git client* is where the magic happens

And what is Git?

* Git is a version control system
* Developed by Linus Torvalds (inventor of Linux)
* It tracks changes in a series of *commits* and tracks different phases of development in *branches* which eventually get merged into the deployed version
